2016-08-22 21:31 Make this for my little daughter.
Hope this will help us taking care of our sweetie.

2016-08-23 15:10 A plan is coming.
I've found out a tiny RF module from Hshop.vn. The sensor NJL5501R has been ordered already.

2016-08-23 22:07 Need a protocol.
I would need a protocol to deal with RF ASK transceiver.

2016-08-24 10:53 Need to use RF24L01 module.
ASK modulation is not ssuitable for data collection. I found a tutorial for using RF24L01 with AVR. Need to check it out.
